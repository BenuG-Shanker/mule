In, first named folder, we have tried to implement the some basic integration ways by using anypoint studio's modules and there expressions and functions such as 
  > Core > Logger
  > Http > Listener
We have firstly, dragged the listener form the mule palett and drop it down on the canvas, and do the same process with the logger one.
Have, provided and message in the looger and logger is used only for providing the invoking message when listener got invoked every time.
Then, in listener we have set the path as '/first', and done some configuration by editing the port to '8081' and testing the connection and then hit ok.
After, saving the work we right click the mouse on the canvas and select the run option from there.
And, Studio had started running the application and then automatically get switched to mule runtime environment and environment will deploye the API using open JDK platform.
for invoking the mule project using external rest based api for testing the project implementation; we have to proide the URL as http://localhost/8081/first, and then hit send button, and in studio we get our message which had invoked by using looger from core module.
Lastly, our API is ready and working excellant.
