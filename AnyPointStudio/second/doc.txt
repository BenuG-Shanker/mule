In, second named mule application, we have done some implementation regarding the debugging of the application using below modules and there functions and expressions
    > Core > Logger
    > Core > Set Variable
    > Core > Flow
    > HTTP > Listner
firstly, we have created the application in the studio, and then create the api by dragging and dropping the needed modules and there functions
then, first drop Flow function from the Core Module, where we are having two seperations ie.e, source and process, and function of source is to start the flow of the mule application which can be done by any web service triggered point or scheduled jobs or subscription of messages, etc, and function of process part is to implement the working of the mule application as per the need.
Then, in source part drop the Listner function from the HTTP module and set the port within the configuration settings of the http by clicking plus button, and then update the path as "/second".
After that, for triggering some messages use the Logger function from the Core module and update the message as "my logger message has been invoked", and then drop setvariable function from the core module and update the name of the variable as var1 and feed the value of it to 10, then again drop the looger function by changing the message to "my second logger message has been invoked"
Run the application by right clicking on the canvas and selecting the run option, for checking no error.
Then invoke the application by using external rest based api client, by updating the URL as "http://localhost/8081/second", and then click send button after that look the status 200 OK which is telling the application is doing good.
If, there is no error, then by same procedure open debugger, and seeing that, studio will start the debugging process first in Maven Output, then reach to the application.
before the start of the appilication create the toggle breakpoint in the starting logger function.
and, while in debugger, mule debug perspective will open, and hit send button from the external rest api utility, for starting and invoking the mule project, then in mule debug perspective, hit the change the process button for invoking each function from various modules, at first listener will get invoke and api will start from the event source part of the flow function of the core module, and the after the change of process logger function will invoke and in console message will appear, then set varaible function get invoke and before the invoke, the value of the variable var1 will be 0, and after the invoke value will get changed to 10, lastly, the process will get changed to logger button, after the invoke of the second logger function message will appear in the console and debugger window will get empty.
after that utility software will show the 200 OK status, for showing the successful implementation of the mule anypointstudio project.
