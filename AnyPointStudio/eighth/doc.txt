In Eighth named, mulesoft application we have used below, modules and components i.e.,
   > Core > Logger
   > HTTP > Listener
We have created the flow and renamed it as "eighthpublishflow", and drop the listener method from the http module, 
and update the path as "/eighth" and update the http configuration port as "8081", and test the connection and then click ok button.
Then, we have dropped logger method from the core module, and in message we have clicked on the fx button and write "payload".
Now, we reach out to the external rest based utility software and inplace of GET opt for POST and update the URL as "http://localhost:8081/eighth" and
opt body option and then opt raw and in below box write as given below i.e.,
{
  "name":"Benu",
  "email":"benugopal786@gmail.com"
}
and then hit send button, after that we will get 200 ok status from our utility software and logger payload given from our utility side will be available in console.
This, makes our application to work successfully.
